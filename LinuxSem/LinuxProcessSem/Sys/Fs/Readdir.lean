  * LinuxProcessSem.Sys.Fs.Readdir — getdents64 (61)

  This file answers to Linux `fs/readdir.c`: it holds what the kernel
  defines there, and nothing else.  Which file a spec belongs in is
  therefore not a judgement call — look up where the kernel defines
  the syscall.  `Specs.lean` carries the whole map.

  TRUST BOUNDARY: this file is part of the trusted specification.
  `Specs.lean` holds the dispatcher and re-exports this module; see that
  file's header for the representation and fail-closed conventions
  every spec here follows.

  A spec's monad is `SysSpec SyscallEffect` from `MonadInstances`, fixed
  at the concrete `Model`/`SyscallInput`/`event`.  The 
  `sys_scope` sequencing `x <- c ;; k` is `bind c (fun x => k)` in Lean,
  which is how the one `get_model` step and the `errno_from` step below
  are written.  `ret_only`, `err_ret`, `errno_from` and `sint32` are
  `Sys/Syscall.lean`'s, and `m_fds`/`fd_lookup` are `StateLedger`/
  `StateFd`'s.

/-- getdents64's injectable failure: one environment condition the model
    does not track, and the only one getdents(2) documents that a
    modeled arm could otherwise preempt.  `iterate_dir` (Linux
    fs/readdir.c, v6.18.46) answers -ENOENT for `IS_DEADDIR(inode)` — a
    directory removed since the fd was opened — and does so BEFORE it
    calls the filesystem's `.iterate_shared`, hence before the -EINVAL
    below is reached.

    -EBADF and -ENOTDIR are NOT injectable: both are decided from state
    the model does carry (the fd table, and the fd's kind).  -EFAULT is
    not either: every arm this spec admits is settled before the kernel
    touches the destination buffer — see the note at
    `getdents64_spec`. -/
def getdents64_errnos : List Int := [ENOENT]

/-- The SMALLEST record any directory entry can occupy in a
    `struct linux_dirent64` buffer, in bytes.

    `filldir64` (Linux fs/readdir.c, v6.18.46) computes

      reclen = ALIGN(offsetof(struct linux_dirent64, d_name) + namlen + 1,
                     sizeof(u64))

    and `struct linux_dirent64` (Linux include/linux/dirent.h, v6.18.46)
    is `u64 d_ino; s64 d_off; unsigned short d_reclen; unsigned char
    d_type; char d_name[]`, so `offsetof(..., d_name)` is 19.  A name is
    at least one byte — `verify_dirent_name` (Linux fs/readdir.c,
    v6.18.46) refuses `len <= 0`, and no filesystem emits an empty
    name — so
    `reclen >= ALIGN(19 + 1 + 1, 8) = 24`, with equality for the
    one-byte name ".".

    This is a floor over ALL entries, not a fact about any one of them,
    which is what lets the spec use it without knowing what the
    directory holds. -/
def dirent64_min_reclen : Int := 24

/-- The buffer size AS THE KERNEL COMPARES IT.  `count` arrives declared
    `unsigned int` (`SYSCALL_DEFINE3(getdents64, unsigned int, fd,
    struct linux_dirent64 __user *, dirent, unsigned int, count)`, Linux
    fs/readdir.c, v6.18.46), so the high half of the register is gone
    before anything reads it — the same narrowing `Syscall.fd32`
    describes for a file descriptor.  It is then stored into
    `ctx.count`, which `struct dir_context` (Linux include/linux/fs.h,
    v6.18.46) declares `int`, and `filldir64`'s `reclen > ctx->count` is
    a SIGNED comparison.

    So the two conversions compose into "the low 32 bits, read as two's
    complement", which is exactly `Syscall.sint32` — and the composition
    is observable rather than pedantic: a `count` at or above 2^31 is a
    NEGATIVE `ctx->count`, so `getdents64(dirfd, buf, 0x80000000)` is
    -EINVAL on Linux, not a large successful read.  Comparing the
    unsigned register instead would have admitted a success no kernel
    produces. -/

def getdents64_no_room (count : word) : Bool :=

/-- `getdents64 fd dirent count`: read directory entries into `dirent`.

    THE SUCCESS ARM IS NOT MODELED, AND CANNOT BE FROM WHAT THIS MODEL
    CARRIES.  A successful call fills the buffer with `struct
    linux_dirent64` records — `d_ino`, `d_off`, `d_reclen`, `d_type` and
    the name — and returns the byte count.  Three INDEPENDENT things
    stand in the way, and closing any one of them leaves the other two:

    - `State.FdDir` IS NULLARY.  It records that the fd names a
      directory and nothing else, so the model cannot tell an fd opened
      on "." from one opened on ".." — the only two paths
      `Open.path_is_dirref` admits.  Enumerating the working directory
      for BOTH is a confident wrong answer for one of them, and the
      model has nothing to branch on.  `Open.openat_spec` answers ".."
      at all only because nothing the model can then do to the fd tells
      the two apart — read is -EISDIR for either, close is close, lseek
      is declined — and this spec is the clause of that argument that
      names getdents64.  A listing arm would break it, not merely be
      wrong on its own.
    - `Fs.Fs` IS A MAP FROM PATH TO CONTENTS and holds no metadata, so
      `d_ino` and `d_type` are not derivable from it, and neither is the
      `d_off` cookie, which is the filesystem's own opaque position.
      That is the same wall `Stat.newfstatat_spec` hits: "A spec that
      answered the call would be inventing the rest".
    - THE KEY SET IS NOT THE DIRECTORY.  Even granting the two above,
      the map's keys do not enumerate the working directory: a real
      EMPTY subdirectory leaves no key at all, "." and ".." are entries
      of every real directory and keys of none, and a key "a/b" implies
      a directory "a" the map cannot hold.  `Namei.unlinkat_spec`'s
      WORLD paragraph states that correspondence and its hole, a
      divergence kept rather than fixed.  A listing read off the
      keys would report a directory Linux would not.

    So the enumerate-the-image shape is declined, and the FAILING side —
    the part of the call that writes nothing — is what is modeled,
    exactly as `Stat.newfstatat_spec` models its own.

    `dirent` IS NOT AN ARGUMENT OF THIS SPEC, and its arity is the
    statement that no modeled arm can deliver a byte, and hence that
    none can fault on the destination either.  `filldir64` reaches
    `user_write_access_begin` only AFTER the `reclen > ctx->count` test,
    so on the one directory arm below the kernel has not touched the
    buffer: `getdents64(dirfd, NULL, 0)` is -EINVAL, not -EFAULT.

    ORDER, following the kernel's exactly (Linux fs/readdir.c,
    v6.18.46, `SYSCALL_DEFINE3(getdents64)` and `iterate_dir`):

    - the fd first.  `CLASS(fd_pos, f)(fd)` is `fdget_pos`, and
      `fd_empty(f)` returns -EBADF before `iterate_dir` is entered, so a
      closed fd is -EBADF whatever kind of object the number would have
      named.  `fd` arrives already truncated to 32 bits (see
      `Syscall.fd32`), so `getdents64(2^32, ...)` names fd 0.
    - then the fd's KIND.  `iterate_dir` opens with

        int res = -ENOTDIR;
        if (!file->f_op->iterate_shared)
                goto out;

      so -ENOTDIR precedes `security_file_permission`,
      `fsnotify_file_perm`, the inode lock and the `IS_DEADDIR` test
      alike.  It is the FIRST thing that function does.
    - then, on a directory, the buffer size, in `filldir64`.

    -ENOTDIR ON EVERY NON-DIRECTORY, and here the model spends nothing.
    `.iterate_shared` is the directory iterator: no file_operations
    table for a non-directory object defines one, so the answer does not
    turn on WHICH object a channel or a file fd is attached to.  That is
    strictly weaker than what `Sync.fsync_spec` needs — its -EINVAL for
    a channel rests on the channel being a pipe, and plain shell
    redirection falsifies it — so the same
    redirection leaves this arm untouched: a regular file on fd 1 is
    -ENOTDIR just as a pipe is.  Checked at v6.18.46: `pipefifo_fops`
    and `pipeanon_fops` (fs/pipe.c), `socket_file_ops` (net/socket.c),
    `ext4_file_operations` (fs/ext4/file.c), `shmem_file_operations`
    (mm/shmem.c), `null_fops` (drivers/char/mem.c) and `tty_fops`
    (drivers/tty/tty_io.c) — not one of those six files contains the
    token `iterate_shared` at all.

    -EINVAL FOR A BUFFER TOO SMALL FOR THE FIRST ENTRY.  `filldir64`
    sets `buf->error = -EINVAL` and returns false on
    `reclen > ctx->count`, which `dir_emit_dots` (Linux
    include/linux/fs.h, v6.18.46) turns into a zero-length iteration and
    `SYSCALL_DEFINE3(getdents64)` then reports, since `buf.prev_reclen`
    is still 0 and the `error = count - buf.ctx.count` rewrite is
    skipped.  `dirent64_min_reclen` bounds `reclen` from below over
    every possible entry, so a `ctx->count` under 24 cannot fit ANY
    entry and the answer does not depend on the directory's contents.

    THAT ARM RESTS ON ONE PREMISE, stated here because it is what a
    later change has to re-check: THE ITERATION EMITS AT LEAST ONE
    ENTRY.  A directory with nothing left to emit returns 0, not
    -EINVAL.  Two facts make it hold:

    - The iteration at position 0 emits "." first.  `dir_emit_dots`
      (Linux include/linux/fs.h, v6.18.46) is the generic opener, and it
      is the FIRST STATEMENT of the readdir every filesystem a modeled
      run can sit on installs: tmpfs's `offset_readdir`, reached through
      `simple_offset_dir_operations` (Linux fs/libfs.c, v6.18.46), and
      sysfs's `kernfs_fop_readdir` (Linux fs/kernfs/dir.c, v6.18.46) and
      procfs's `proc_readdir_de` (Linux fs/proc/generic.c, v6.18.46).
      THIS IS THE BOUND WORTH NAMING, in the shape `Sync.fsync_spec`'s
      directory arm names its own: it holds of THOSE filesystems, not of
      every filesystem, and one whose directory yielded nothing at
      position 0 would answer 0 where this arm says -EINVAL.
    - Every `FdDir` a modeled run can hold IS at position 0.
      `State.FdDir` carries no position field, and nothing modeled gives
      it one: `Open.openat_spec` mints it from a fresh open,
      `ReadWrite.lseek_spec` DECLINES a directory fd,
      `ReadWrite.read_spec` answers -EISDIR without moving anything,
      `Fork.clone_spec` shares a `struct file` neither branch can
      advance, and this spec's own only non-declining directory arm does
      not advance it either — `filldir64` refuses on the size and writes
      nothing at all, `dir_emit_dots` leaves `ctx->pos` at 0 when
      `dir_emit_dot` returns false, and `iterate_dir`'s
      `file->f_pos = ctx->pos` then writes back the 0 it read.

      GIVE `FdDir` A POSITION, or give this spec a success arm that
      advances one, and the premise stops being free: the -EINVAL would
      then have to be conditioned on the position, because a directory
      read to its end answers 0 to the very same call.

    APPROXIMATION, and it is a NARROWING rather than a wrong answer.
    Two untracked conditions sit between the -ENOTDIR and the -EINVAL —
    `security_file_permission`'s LSM verdict and `fsnotify_file_perm`'s
    fanotify permission response — and neither errno is documented for
    getdents(2), so neither is offered here.  Under an LSM that denies
    the read, or a fanotify listener that answers FAN_DENY, this spec
    REJECTS a conforming trace on the directory arm.  (`down_read_killable`'s
    -EINTR is a third, and is unreachable rather than approximated: it
    fires only on a fatal signal, which kills the task before any return
    value reaches userspace.)  The -EBADF and -ENOTDIR arms are behind
    none of the three and are unconditional.

    Nothing is written on any admitted arm, so every effect is a bare
    return with five empty ledgers, and no arm reads user memory either
    — hence no copy-in ledger. -/

/-! ## Sanity checks

  It is five definitions and the prose above. The checks below are PORT CHECKS, and
  they pin the three computable things the header argues for:

    - the `struct linux_dirent64` layout, and hence that
      `dirent64_min_reclen` really is the smallest record;
    - the signed `ctx->count` read, and the -EINVAL it forces on a
      buffer under 24 bytes (and on a `count` with bit 31 set);
    - the modelled arms of `getdents64_spec` against a concrete model:
      -EBADF for an fd that is not open, -ENOTDIR for every
      non-directory, both the injectable -ENOENT and the deterministic
      -EINVAL on a directory with too small a buffer, and `unmodeled`
      once the buffer could hold an entry. -/
