  * Examples.MeasureLibDemo.StdinGeometric — the standard-input family's
    certificates, worked

  DEMO FILE (not part of the trusted specification, and not installed).
  [MeasureLib]'s own worked demonstration instantiates
  [MeasureLib.stdin_geometric] as the background of a mixture and uses
  its CYLINDER bound.  The family exports three more facts a task
  prints beside a declared mass, and this file instantiates each at
  one concrete stop weight:

  - the LENGTH SLICE, [MeasureLib.stdin_geometric_slice_bound]: every
    admissible list whose members' standard inputs all have the same
    length weighs at most [p (1 - p)^n].  It charges the 256
    alternatives per byte NOTHING, which is what makes it the bound a
    task uses when its fire set is described by length rather than by
    a prefix;
  - the LOWER CERTIFICATE,
    [MeasureLib.stdin_geometric_mass_lower_certificate]: for every
    margin, some admissible list gets within it of the declared mass;
  - and the fact that the mass is a SUPREMUM,
    [MeasureLib.stdin_geometric_mass_supremum_not_maximum]: no
    admissible list attains it.

  The three together are the honest reading of a declared [1]:
  approached to any margin, never reached, and bounded above on every
  list.  A task that prints only the upper half has said nothing about
  whether its declared mass is an overstatement.

  ** The finite witness the lower certificate runs on

  [MeasureLib.geo_lower_witness argv envp fs k] is the family of cores
  whose standard input is SHORTER than [k] bytes, one record each; it
  is finite, duplicate-free, and weighs [1 - (1 - p)^k] exactly
  ([stdin_demo_witness_weighs_the_tail] below).  That closed form is
  where the certificate's margin arithmetic happens, and instantiating
  it at a concrete depth is the cheapest way to see that the
  certificate is a construction rather than an existence claim.

  Nothing exhibited here is claimed VALID and nothing is claimed
  rejected by any classifier.
