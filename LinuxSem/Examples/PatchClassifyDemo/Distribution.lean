  * Examples.PatchClassifyDemo.Distribution — the demo's declared
    weight and total

  DEMO FILE (not part of the trusted specification).  The sixth thing
  `EquivalenceDefinition.PatchClassifySpec.SPEC_PATCH_CLASSIFY` takes,
  after the six images, is a `Measure.DISTRIBUTION`: a weight on finite
  inputs and a declared total mass.  This file supplies one for the
  demo and proves the single fact the demo's two bounds are read off.

  ** It is METADATA, and the demo does not get to be judged by it

  `PatchClassifySpec`'s header is explicit that `W` is trusted,
  per-problem metadata: a task ships it, a submission never proves it,
  and `Measure`'s header adds that nothing ties the declared `M` to the
  weight — there is no normalization obligation anywhere in the layer.
  So the two obligations inside `Measure.DISTRIBUTION` are about the
  weight function alone, and both are discharged here by the library's
  own lemmas (`MeasureLib.cd_lift_nonneg` and
  `MeasureLib.cd_lift_core_blind`) with no proof written by hand.
  That is `MeasureLib`'s design claim, cashed at the size of
  distribution this demo ships.

  ** The choice, and what it is NOT chosen to make easy

  `MeasureLib.stdin_geometric` at stop weight `1 / 8`, over one fixed
  launch-time environment: a program invoked with one empty argument,
  no environment and an empty file system.  A core weighs
  `p (1 - p)^n / 256^n` when its standard input is `n` bytes long and
  its other three fields are those, and nothing at all otherwise.  The
  declared mass is `1`.

  Nothing about this choice is tuned to the demo's classifiers.  It
  could not be: both of them fire on EVERY input, so the set the two
  bounds below measure is the whole space, and the bound they get is
  the one any distribution would give — its own declared mass.  A
  weight concentrated on the inputs the classifiers happen to reject
  would be the dishonest move here, and there is no such thing to
  concentrate on.

  The environment is `Checks.Examples`' one — `[[]]` for argv, nothing
  for the environment, an empty file system — because that is the one
  the demo's own validity witnesses use, so a reader can see that the
  inputs the bites below exhibit are inside the support rather than
  beside it.  It carries no weight in the proof: the certificate this
  file uses holds for every admissible list, including lists of cores
  the weight sends to zero.

  ** The one fact proved here

  `demo_whole_space_bound`: for ANY image and any admissible list of
  finite inputs, the weights already summed do not exceed `1 * M`.
  That is `MeasureLib.stdin_geometric_mass_upper` — the whole-space
  certificate — plus the arithmetic that turns `M` into `1 * M`.

  Note what it does NOT mention: the classifier, and the reject set.
  `Measure.weight_bound_T`'s hypothesis that every entry of the list is
  rejected is DISCARDED here, which is exactly why the bound is `1`:
  the claim being made is that the fire set weighs no more than
  everything does.  At a fire set that really is everything — which is
  what these two classifiers have — that is the honest bound.

  It is NOT claimed here, or anywhere in the demo, that `1` is the
  LEAST multiplier provable for these classifiers.  That inference is
  the one `MeasureLib`'s header names as the misreading a consumer of
  that library is positioned to make: the certificate pair bounds the
  partial sums over ALL admissible lists, while an obligation ranges
  over the lists a classifier REJECTS, and the supremum over those may
  be strictly smaller.  What the demo does prove, in `Obligations`
  (`Obligations.demo_b_zero_refutable`,
  `Obligations.demo_b_half_refutable`), is the weaker and checkable
  thing: against THIS weight and THIS total the multiplier cannot be
  dropped to `0` and cannot be halved, so `b = 1` is a real claim
  rather than a number any distribution would satisfy.

/-- The stop weight.  An authored number, like every other one here:
    `1 / 8` makes a typical standard input a few bytes long and is far
    enough from both `0` and `1` that neither degenerate case is being
    exercised by accident — `MeasureLib`'s worked distribution makes the
    same choice for the same reason.

  A bare `1 / 8` in a statement would elaborate at `Nat` with no
  `Rat`-typed operand to fix the type; the annotation is what keeps the
  statement meaning what it says. -/

    core either matches the fixed environment, and so lies in the
    cylinder over the empty prefix, or weighs nothing" — and the only
    work here is the crossing between `Measure.sum_weights` of the
    lifted weight and `MeasureLib.core_sum` of the core weight, which
    `MeasureLib.core_sum_cd_lift` makes an `=` by conversion.

    Stated for an ARBITRARY image, because it says nothing about any
    classifier: the rejection hypothesis of `Measure.weight_bound_T` is
    the one thing the proof never reads. -/
