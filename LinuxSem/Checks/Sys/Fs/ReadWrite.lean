  * LinuxProcessSem.Checks.Sys.Fs.ReadWrite — the read (63), write (64),
    pread64 (67), pwrite64 (68), writev (66), readv (65), lseek (62)
    checkers, and their proofs

  Answers to Linux [fs/read_write.c]: this file holds the checkers for the
  syscalls defined there, and no others.

  [Checks/ExecutableSpecs.lean] keeps the dispatcher and the four top-level
  theorems and re-exports this module.  The checkers here are executable,
  and their proofs relate them to the relational specs in the matching
  [Sys] module.

  A word is read UNSIGNED (`(w.toNat : Int)`); a `Bool` comparison is `==`
  or `decide (· < ·)` / `decide (· ≤ ·)`; list operations are
  `List.length` / `List.take` / `List.drop` / `List.flatten`; and
  `CheckOk` / `CheckReject` / `CheckUnmodeled` are the constructors of
  `check_result` (`Checks.Sys.Prelude`).

  Lean's `match` has no or-pattern, so `Some (FdFile p _)` and
  `Some (FdFileRW p _)` are two arms with one body each; the bodies are the
  same text.

  One declaration below is PUBLIC and is this file's own: the theorem
  [check_readv_imported_frame], stated beside [check_readv_imported] itself
  because [Checks/VmMapsDisjoint.lean] has to name it (the same reason
  `Checks/Sys/Fs/Open.lean` states [check_ftruncate_file_arm_frame] beside
  its checker).  Its proof is the checker side of
  [check_readv_imported_sound_ok] (`ReadWrite/Vec.lean`) with the spec
  dropped.

  This file holds `readv_heap_gap_no_ok` and the `check_read`,
  `check_read_urandom`, `check_lseek`, `check_pread64` and `check_pwrite64`
  quadruples; the `check_write`, `check_writev`, `check_readv_imported` and
  `check_readv` quadruples live in `ReadWrite/Write.lean`,
  `ReadWrite/Vec.lean` and `ReadWrite/Readv.lean`.  The recipe those proofs
  follow (`check_pwrite64_*` is the smallest complete example):

  (1) PROLOGUE.  Peel `bind inputSpec ;; bind getModelSpec` with
      `bind_ok0` (accepted outcomes) or `bind_unmodeled2` (declines); in
      the completeness directions rewrite it away instead with
      `simp only [inputSpec, getModelSpec, bind_input_spec, bind_getModel] at Hs`
      — [bind_input_spec] is what makes that possible (a
      `(bind_input_model_iff ?_ …).mp Hs` leaves the continuation's
      metavariable unsolved: the unification happens under the bind).
  (2) FD DISPATCH.  `generalize hq : fd_lookup (m_fds m) fd = q at H ⊢`
      then `cases q` (and `cases e` for the `some e` branch), and in every
      arm `try dsimp only at H ⊢` before anything else: `simp` alone leaves
      an already-`some`/`none`-headed `match` unreduced, which is the file
      kinds' `match some (FdEntry.FdFile p off) with …`.
  (3) EFFECT INVERSION.  After `obtain ⟨ret, ws, zs, us, cs, ks⟩ := eff`
      the acceptor's `match eff with | ⟨ret,[(a,bs)],[],[],[],[]⟩ => …`
      still does NOT reduce: `ws` must be decomposed one level further
      (`cases ws with | nil => … | cons hd tl => obtain ⟨a,bs⟩ := hd;
      cases tl <;> cases zs <;> cases us <;> cases cs <;> cases ks`), and
      then `dsimp only at H` in the live branch reduces the match to the
      leaf `if`.  The first goal after the `cases` cascade is the live one;
      the rest are dead and are closed by
      `all_goals (try dsimp only at H); all_goals (try contradiction)`.
      `exact nomatch H` is NOT usable for those dead shapes when `H` is an
      unreduced `if … = .CheckOk …`: its "Missing cases: _" error is not
      backtrackable, so `try`/`first` do not skip it.  `contradiction` is.
  (4) SCRUTINEE EQUATIONS.  `cases h : e` only generalises the TARGET, so
      a hypothesis mentioning `e` keeps an unreduced `match`; use
      `generalize h : e = x at H ⊢` + `cases x` (as [check_pread64_*] does
      for `Fs.file_read` and `write_source`), or add `simp only [h] at H ⊢`
      in every branch (as [check_read_urandom_*] does).
  (5) LEAVES.  `check_ret_only` accepts exactly the spec's `ret_only` /
      `err_ret` leaf ([ret_only_ok_spec] below, one step); a ledger leaf
      inverts with `check_ret_only_copyins_ok_iff` and rebuilds with
      `record_copyins_ok_empty`; a `seqSpec (set_fs …) (record_copyins …)`
      leaf inverts with [seqSpec_set_fs_record_ret_only_ok_inv] and
      declines with [seqSpec_set_fs_unmodeled_inv].  In the completeness
      directions invert the spec side with `seqSpec_modify_pure_ok_inv` /
      [seqSpec_set_fs_record_ret_only_ok_inv] or `cases Hs`, and finish
      with `simp [check_ret_only, bv_eqb_refl]` (or
      `check_ret_only_copyins_refl`).  Wrap completion leaves as
      `cases Hs` + `try simp […]` / `try rfl`: a plain `simp`/`rfl` after a
      `cases` that already closed the goal is a "No goals to be solved"
      error.
  (6) MACROS.  The leaves must be THEOREMS, not tactic macros: Lean's
      macro hygiene renames `H`, `eff`, `m`, `m'`, `evs` inside a
      quotation (`H✝`), so a macro cannot refer to the caller's
      hypotheses.
  (7) SIX MORE FOOTGUNS, found on the `check_read` pair:

      (a) `ok_zsplit` / `ok_zsplit_c` below split `check_access_ok_zero`
          against `access_ok_zero` at one `access_okb` verdict.
          [Checks.Sys.Uaccess.ok_zero_cases] does NOT work: it `cases`es
          the scrutinee, which generalises only the target, so the
          hypothesis keeps its `if` (footgun (4)).  The `_c` form is the
          completeness direction's, where the checker is the GOAL and the
          spec the hypothesis.
      (b) DO NOT `subst` the equalities a passing checker test encodes.
          `ha : bv_eqb a buf = true` has to become `a = buf` first, and
          `subst` then eliminates whichever side it likes — for the read
          arms it eliminated the PARAMETER `buf` and not the pattern
          variable, exactly the footgun the recipe's item (4) warns about.
          `rw [ha', hret']` on the goal is what works.
      (c) `SocketState`/`NetStep` are the tree's shapes: `NetStep.cons`
          takes ONE byte (a `NetStream` is `Nat → NetStep`), so
          `cases rx 0` has the single arm `| cons b0 =>` and the tail is
          `rx` itself.
      (d) The two `err_ret`s (`Sys.Syscall` and `Sys.Uaccess`) are both open
          in this file, so a bare `err_ret` in a NEW statement is
          ambiguous; qualify it.
      (e) A checker leaf under `check_access_ok_zero` is still an `if`
          after the effect cases: `unfold check_socket_pending_error at H`
          (and `unfold socket_pending_error` on the spec side) is what lets
          the split see it.
      (f) In the completeness direction the effect has to be reduced out of
          the checker's `match eff with | ⟨ret, [(a, bs)], …⟩` before the
          delivered-prefix guard can be rewritten: `simp only [mkEffect]`
          after substituting the spec's effect, since `dsimp` alone does not
          unfold `mkEffect` inside a match scrutinee.

  (8) `lseek`'s spec tests `SEEK_MAX < bv_unsigned whence` as a PROP, while
      the checker tests `decide (…) = true` as a BOOL: rewrite the spec side
      with `ite_eq_left (of_decide_eq_true hw)` / `ite_eq_right (fun hP => hw
      (decide_eq_true hP))` and the checker side with `ite_eq_left hw`.

  (9) THE `check_read` COMPLETENESS PAIR, and three things it needed that
      are worth carrying to the other quadruples:

      (a) A COMPLETENESS LEAF IS INVERTED, NOT `cases`d.  `cases Hs` only
          does the job when the spec's leaf is a `pure` (then `Hs` is an
          `Outcome.ok … = .unmodeled` clash, or substitutes the three
          unknowns); a `seqSpec (set_fds …) (pure e)` leaf needs
          [seqSpec_set_fds_pure_ok_inv] (ditto set_pipes / set_stdin /
          set_fs / record_copyins), and the RST / ETIMEDOUT arm needs
          [seqSpec_set_fds_err_ret_ok_inv].  `cases Hs` on a `bind` /
          `seqSpec` chain leaves `∃ …` goals behind — that is the failure
          mode to watch for, and "No goals to be solved" at the *next*
          tactic is the other one (a `dsimp only at Hs ⊢` can already close
          a leaf whose checker arm is literally `.CheckUnmodeled`, because
          `dsimp` discharges an `X = X`).
      (b) `check_access_ok_zero` IS POSITIVE, `access_ok_zero` IS NEGATIVE
          only in /dev/null's arm: everywhere else `ok_zsplit_c Hs buf
          count` splits both sides at one verdict.  /dev/null's spec spells
          the test `if !access_okb … then -EFAULT`, so it needs the manual
          `by_cases hok : access_okb … = true` pair
          (`rw [ite_eq_right (by simp [hok])] at Hs` beside `rw [ite_eq_left hok]`)
          that [check_read_sound_ok] already uses in the other direction.
      (c) THE NO-DECLINE TOOLKIT ([pure_no_unmodeled],
          [emit_no_unmodeled], [choose_no_unmodeled],
          [modifySpec_no_unmodeled], [bind_no_unmodeled],
          [seqSpec_no_unmodeled], [modifySeq_no_unmodeled],
          [emitSeq_no_unmodeled], [deliverSeq_no_unmodeled],
          [choose_bind_no_unmodeled], [seqSpec_pure_no_unmodeled],
          [access_ok_zero_unmodeled_iff]) is what refutes the branches
          where the spec CANNOT decline: in the completeness-unmodeled
          direction those branches are `absurd Hs (…)`, never an effect
          cascade — the cascade is the SOUND direction's problem.
          `set_fs` / `set_fds` / `set_pipes` / `set_stdin` are all
          `modifySpec (with_… …)`, so `modifySeq_no_unmodeled` states them
          all.

  (10) THE `check_write_*` SHAPE.  `write_spec` is `write_range_gate buf
      count` (an `if !modeled_rw_range … then unmodeled else k`, so a
      `by_cases hmr` per file arm, with `exact nomatch H` / `rfl` on the
      gate-true side) wrapped round either `access_ok_zero` or
      `write_file_tail i.in_mem buf count place`.  `write_file_tail` binds
      `bs` to `write_source …`, answers -EFAULT when `!w_is0 count &&
      (bs.length == 0)`, builds `deliver` from `place bs` (`none` giving
      `unmodeled`, `some upd` giving `upd (write_ledger buf count bs)`), and
      closes with `access_ok_zero buf count deliver` when `e_is0 count` and
      `deliver` otherwise.  The order to walk is: gate →
      `generalize hbs : write_source … = bs` → the
      -EFAULT `if` → `place` (`cases hfs : Fs.fs_lookup …`, then the
      `modeled_file_gap` `if` where the arm has one) → `w_is0 count` (which
      picks `write_ledger`'s `ret_only` / `record_copyins` leaf and takes
      the `access_ok_zero` with it).  The CHANNEL arm has no gate-free
      `place`: after `bs.length == 0`, its leaf is
      `bind (choose (fun ds => 1 ≤ ds.length ∧ ds.length ≤ rw_count_clamp
      count ∧ ds = bs.take ds.length)) (fun ds => seqSpec (emit (ds.map
      (WriteEv ch))) (record_copyins [(buf, ds.length)] (ret_only (len_word
      ds))))`, so `check_write_sound_ok` must build it at `ds` chosen as
      `bs.take ret.toNat`, out of the checker's `1 ≤ ret.toNat &&
      ret.toNat ≤ bs.length` and `copyins = [(buf, ret.toNat)]`, and needs
      three facts:

        · `(bs.take ret.toNat).length = ret.toNat`
          (`List.length_take` + `Nat.min_eq_left (Int.ofNat_le.mp h)`);
        · `(bs.take ret.toNat).length ≤ rw_count_clamp count`
          (`Uaccess.write_source_length_le` at `hbs`);
        · `len_word (bs.take ret.toNat) = ret` — the checker never says the
          RETURN is `len_word` of the prefix, only that its `toNat` matches
          the ledger, so this is `BitVec.ofNat 64 ret.toNat = ret`
          (`BitVec.eq_of_toNat_eq` + `BitVec.toNat_ofNat` +
          `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt ret.isLt`).  `bitvec` does NOT give it
          definitionally; that is the one genuinely new ingredient the write
          CHANNEL arm adds over the read one.
      The three FILE arms and /dev/null then reuse `access_ok_zero` /
      `write_range_gate` splits and the two `write_ledger` leaves, and the
      PIPE arm walks `pipe_end_live` → `pipe_lookup` → `pipe_write_room` →
      `bs.length == word_to_nat count` before its
      `check_ret_only_copyins` leaf.

  The proofs `cases` the effect's six fields and close the dead shapes with
  `exact nomatch H` (footgun (d)).  A function-typed `if` whose test narrows
  a word is split with the `generalize hP : … = Q at *` pattern of footgun
  (a) wherever `by_cases` would loop.

   `check_readv_imported`'s `m_vmmaps` frame (PUBLIC)

   [Checks/VmMapsDisjoint.lean] must show that each checker leaves
   [m_vmmaps] alone.  Its `vm_frame` loop does that by unfolding the
   checker and casing the result hypothesis, and the imported-vector body
   is where that loop needs the fact stated, so it is stated HERE, next to
   the checker it is about, exactly as `Checks/Sys/Fs/Open.lean`'s
   `check_ftruncate_file_arm_frame` and `Checks/Sys/Fs/Namei.lean`'s
   `check_unlinkat_body_frame` are stated next to theirs.

   Why it cannot come from the `*_sound_ok` next door, and why the wrapper
   lemmas do not substitute for it: `check_copyin_prefix_model` (like
   every other `*_model` inversion) returns an equality of the INNER
   result, not `m' = m`, so it hands the outer frame nothing at this call
   site — the model equality has to be produced by walking the body.

   The walk is the checker side of [check_readv_imported_sound_ok]
   (`ReadWrite/Vec.lean`), with the spec dropped: every accepting branch
   hands back either the caller's model or a `with_stdin`/`with_fds` update
   of it, and a projection of a structure update is the old projection by
   `rfl`.  The two model-state tests (`m_stdin m 0`, `Fs.fs_lookup
   (m_fs m) p`) and the three `scatter_iovecs` imports are `generalize`d,
   never `split`: `split` generalises the stuck `if` under them.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -/

/-- The imported-vector body of `readv` leaves [m_vmmaps] alone: no branch
    of it writes to `m_vm`, and the three that rebuild the model rebuild
    `m_stdin` or `m_fds` only.  Public because
    [Checks/VmMapsDisjoint.lean] cites it as a term. -/

   The shared recipe

   Every quadruple below walks the checker and
   its spec arm for arm, in the order the two definitions make their
   tests, so no test ever has to be commuted:

   (1) the `bind inputSpec ;; bind getModelSpec` prologue is peeled with
       `bind_ok0` (accepted outcomes) or `bind_unmodeled2` (declines);
       in the completeness directions the same prologue is inverted with
       the two bridges above ([bind_input_model_iff] /
       [bind_input_model_inv]) instead;
   (2) the fd dispatch is generalised (`generalize hq : fd_lookup … = q
       at H ⊢`) and then `cases`d, because the checker and the spec
       mention the SAME lookup under DIFFERENT nested constructor
       patterns, and `dsimp only` — not `simp` — is what reduces an
       already-`some`/`none`-headed `match` (the file kinds in particular
       leave an unreduced `match some (FdEntry.FdFile p off) with …`);
   (3) the effect is decomposed (`obtain ⟨ret, ws, zs, us, cs, ks⟩ :=
       eff`, then `ws` to `hd :: tl` and `hd` to `(a, bs)`, then the
       `cases tl <;> cases zs <;> …` cascade); the first goal after the
       cascade is the live shape, the rest are dead and fall to
       `all_goals (try dsimp only at H); all_goals (try contradiction)`
       (`contradiction`, not `nomatch`: an unreduced `if`-shaped `H` is
       not a constructor clash);
   (4) the leaves are [ret_only_ok_spec] (and plain `pure_ok` /
       `unmodeled_intro`), and the equalities a passing checker test
       encodes are extracted with `(Fs.bv_eqb_eq _ _).mp` /
       `(listN_eqb_eq _ _).mp` and rewritten on the GOAL (never `subst`,
       which would eliminate the parameter rather than the pattern
       variable).

/-- `bind input k` at a fixed input.  The reader binds the
    input it was handed and changes nothing, so the chain is the

    peel the `bind inputSpec ;; bind getModelSpec` prologue with this and
    [bind_getModel] instead of naming the continuation. -/

   read (63)

   The four `check_read_*` lemmas below follow the header's recipe, with
   two bridges carrying the shape an inline `eapply bind_ok0` would:

   - [seqSpec_set_*_pure_ok] build a `seqSpec (set_X …) (pure e)` stage at
     its own accepted outcome (the update changes one component of the
     model and emits nothing);
   - [seqSpec_set_*_deliver_ok] build a read's delivery stage — advance
     the stream or the socket script, record one event per delivered
     byte, return the fixed effect — at its own accepted outcome.

   They are stated as OUTCOME CONSTRUCTORS rather than as inversions
   because every direction but the completeness one builds the spec's
   outcome, and the completeness one inverts the checker's leaf with
   [check_ret_only_ok_iff] / [check_ret_only_copyins_ok_iff] anyway.

   read (63) — the completeness directions

   The sound directions above build the spec's outcome from the checker's;
   these invert the spec's outcome instead.  The prologue is
   peeled with [bind_input_spec] / [bind_getModel] (footgun (1) of the
   recipe), the leaves are inverted with [seqSpec_set_*_ok_inv], and the
   delivered-prefix guard is then closed by rewriting with the guard
   lemmas ([read_channel_guard_true] / [read_socket_guard_true] /
   [read_file_guard_true] / [read_pipe_guard_true]).

/-! ### A spec stage that cannot decline

  The completeness directions invert a spec's `.unmodeled` outcome, and
  every leaf but the one the arm means to decline at is a stage that CANNOT
  decline: `pure`, `emit`, `choose`, `modifySpec`, and
  the `seqSpec` / `bind` chains built out of them.  The lemmas below say
  so once each, so the completeness proofs can knock those branches out
  with `absurd Hs (…)` instead of re-deriving it per arm. -/
