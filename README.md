# Lean 4 Linux process semantics

Ported from [theorem-labs/rocq-linux-process-semantics#68ccc39](https://github.com/theorem-labs/rocq-linux-process-semantics/tree/68ccc39).

A Lean 4 formalisation of the Linux process model and the syscall surface a
process actually observes: a RISC-V machine model, an executable specification of
the modelled syscalls, equivalence notions between images, and a verification
layer that checks concrete states against those specifications.

Zero dependencies beyond Lean itself. Toolchain pinned in `lean-toolchain`.

## Layout

| directory | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Riscv/` | the ISA: decode, step, the register/memory helpers, alignment and access reporting |
| `LinuxProcessSem/` | the machine model (`State*`), the syscall specs (`Sys/`), and `Run` — the trace semantics |
| `EquivalenceDefinition/` | what it means for two images to agree: the equivalence, the measures, the classifier surfaces |
| `Checks/` | checkers, witnesses, and the verification layer |
| `Common/` | shared machinery: the symbolic-execution tower, the ASan plan checker and its soundness proof, the tactic library |
| `Examples/` | three worked demonstrations, each with a sealed specification and a proof that it is met |

## Building

```
lake build          # the library and the decoder executable
./scripts/check.sh  # build + hygiene guards (see below)
```

`scripts/check.sh` runs four guards and prints `OK`:

1. `lake build` succeeds;
2. no escape hatches — the tree contains no `sorry` and no added axioms;
3. the axiom audit (`scripts/AxiomAudit.lean`) confirms nothing depends on
   `sorryAx`, and that every headline claim listed there still resolves;
4. the decoder's smoke test succeeds.

## What is proved

The claims below are the repository's headline results. Each is proved, and
shown non-vacuous by a witness, in the module named in the last column; the
first column is the name `scripts/AxiomAudit.lean` pins.

| claim | what it says | where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brk_grant_wf` → `check_syscall_preserves_vm_wf` | an accepted syscall preserves page-granularity disjointness of the mapping ledger. Unconditional: an unmodelled syscall number makes the hypothesis impossible, so there is no coverage premise. `brk` is the case it hinges on; `base_entry_unique` is the payoff. | `Checks/VmMapsDisjoint/` |
| `coexec_progress_iff` | the two co-execution judgments agree, so a claim stated in one currency transfers. | `Checks/Omni.lean` |
| `modeled_sysnos_exact` | the modelled syscall list is exactly the dispatched set, in both directions, and is duplicate-free and non-empty (`Specs.lean`, `modeled_sysnos.length = 90`, by `decide`). | `Checks/DispatchSurface.lean` |
| `abrt_refutes_error_free_abort` | a concrete image whose run dies by SIGABRT, firing the error-free abort refutation rather than merely stating it; `abrt_dies_by_signal` discharges the premise at every limit. | `Checks/AbortWitness.lean` |
| `exits_c_must_exit_at`, `exit0_image_must_exit_zero` | a successful `exits_c` walk forces an exit — for the concrete exit-0 image the walk is closed by `decide`. | `Checks/Examples.lean` |
| `check_sound` | the ASan plan checker is sound against the abstract semantics, over a concrete `LIMIT` kept as an explicit parameter. | `Common/AsanPlanSound.lean` |
| `check_syscall_preserves_vm_fit` → `syscall_spec_preserves_vm_fit` | every accepted syscall keeps `vm_fit`: no live mapping's end wraps past 2^64. Not implied by `vm_wf` — an entry `(2^64 - 4096, 8192)` satisfies that and not this. | `Checks/MapsFit.lean` |
| `star_preserves_sys_inv`, `sys_inv_noaccess_pages_owned` | the protected ledger's invariant (`sys_inv` = `vm_wf` ∧ `vm_fit` ∧ `na_inv`) holds of `init_model`, every step keeps it, and it yields `State.noaccess_pages_owned` — the hypothesis `mremap_fresh_avoids_noaccess` used to take. `na_inv` is the strengthening that makes it inductive: the plain property fails on an unreachable `brk`-orphan state. | `Checks/NoaccessOwned/` |
| `mremap_budget_refused_iff`, `mremap_budget_refused_is_refusal_sys_inv` | the mremap budget mark fires exactly when no placement fits in-place or by moving, and on a state keeping the ledger invariants a marked request has no non-errno resolution. | `Checks/BudgetPremise.lean`, `Checks/BudgetPremiseMremap.lean` |
| `check_munmap_unmap_backing`, `check_munmap_zero_owned` | every unmapping answer cuts the backing ledgers by the range, and a `0` answer outside the exact arm leaves exactly the bytes and pages outside it. | `Checks/MunmapCut.lean` |
| `mm_ok_step`, `mm_ok_no_accesses` | a successful `mmap`, `mremap` or `brk` keeps the run going, is killed by nothing, and touches no user memory. | `Checks/MmStepFrame.lean` |
| `mm_refutes_budgets_only`, `cm_run_budget_only_refused` | the finer budget premise — which does not excuse a request whose charge alone exceeds the whole budget — is refutable on a run, and the cumulative refusal is still excluded. | `Checks/OversizeReachable.lean` |
| `sv48_band_is_linux_set`, `sv39_band_is_linux_set` | the mmap-base band `[mmap_base_min, mmap_base_max]` is EXACTLY the set of bases Linux gives, under two named assumptions, with examples showing each is needed. | `Checks/Cases/MmapBase.lean` |
| `gate_exit0_accepts`, `gate_exit1_rejects` | the accept/reject gate is decided on both demo verdicts. | `Checks/GatedSize.lean` |
| `DemoSealed`, `omni_strong_universal` | the worked demonstrations' sealed specifications (a full `SPEC_PATCH_CLASSIFY` instance, so the classifier surface is inhabited), and proofs that their images meet them. | `Examples/` |

  of the artifact, no proof holes, verify with `lake env lean`).
